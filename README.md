# Habit Tracker

Welcome to **Habit Tracker**, a mobile application built with **React Native** to help users track and manage their daily habits. This is my first project using React Native, created as a learning exercise to practice mobile app development with Expo and modern React Native tools.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **Expo CLI**: Install globally with `npx create-expo-app@latest`
- **Expo Go**: Download the Expo Go app on your iOS or Android device for testing.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Beatrizvn/habit-tracker.git
   cd habit-tracker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
   You can then:
   - Scan the QR code with the Expo Go app on your mobile device.
   - Run on an Android/iOS emulator using `npm run android` or `npm run ios`.
   - Run on the web using `npm run web`.
   - See de docs [where](https://docs.expo.dev/)

## üìù Notes

- This is my first React Native project, so there may be areas for improvement in code structure or performance.
- The app uses Expo SQLite for local storage, meaning data persists on the device but is not synced to a remote server.
- Navigation is implemented using `@react-navigation` with bottom tabs, stack, and drawer navigation for a smooth user experience.


## üôå Acknowledgments

- Thanks to the React Native and Expo communities for their amazing documentation and resources.
